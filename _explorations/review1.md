Café Cocca

I absolutely love coffee and this is some of the best. 
The little caffe is super cute and I visited here on a first date! 
The drinks are so affordable and I decided to try a bunch. 
I tried the double shot, americano, latté, mocha, cappuccino, and flat white. 
Out of all the drinks I tried, the latte was by far the best. 
They were all delicious and I was not able to sleep for 1 week after due to all the caffeine!! This was the best week ever. 
I also ate some of their donuts and french toast which were delicious as well. 
Overall I think my date here went super well because of how delicious and cute this café was so I give it a 10/10. 
I will definitely bring all my friends and buy them all multiple coffees so they can stay as caffeinated as me and we can just have a great time.
