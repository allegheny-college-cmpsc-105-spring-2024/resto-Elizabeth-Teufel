Using my analytics I can see how long people look at my website, how many new users use my website, and how recently it was viewed. 
With a bunch of people clicking on my website now, I am able to see the spike in people viewing my website in google analytics. 
This would be beneficial to know as a restaurant owner to see if your website is getting any attention and potentially bringing you more customers. 
If you click around all the different settings then you can find a ton of additional information. 
This can be used to see how effective your advertising is, or if people could easily navigate your website. 
If you are a real restaurant and you look at your google analytics and no one is viewing your website, then you know that there is probably a problem with how easy it is to access. 
You also know the information you are trying to convey through your website is not being seen.
