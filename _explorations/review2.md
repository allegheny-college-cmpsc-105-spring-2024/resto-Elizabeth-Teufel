Fusion Flavors

I tried the signature dish of fusion tacos. 
These were the best tacos I’ve tried, the shrimp tacos were a great combo of lemon, avocado, shrimp and greens. 
I will definitely be coming back to eat here again. The restaurant was very cute as well. 
I loved the modern decor and hospitality of all the staff. My water gave very quick service and helped me a lot with all of my questions. 
I would highly recommend Fusion Flavors for meeting up with friends to get a drink and bite to eat. 
The water they have here is also excellent. My friend tried the pasta here and it looked delicious as well. 
I would definitely want to try it next time I’m in the area. 
I also found out they host events, I think this could be a great place to have a party or birthday. 
I also think they would be very good to cater for a work event or meeting.
